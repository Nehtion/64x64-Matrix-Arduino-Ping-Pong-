# 64x64-Matrix-Arduino-Ping-Pong-

This is a simple Ping-Pong game for a 64x64 Matrix module.
For this project, I was using the following product:

Additionally, I was using an Arduino Mega 2560
6 Male to Male Jump Wires

For the Connection between the Matrix Module and the Arduino, I used the Hardware Diagram from the following website:

You can see the exact Connections in the Following Image

The Resistor used is 10K Ohm. You don't need to actually use Resistors, I just used them because they take up less Space, which makes the buttons easier to access.

What is also important to know is, that depending on where the ball/sphere hits the Matrix Panel, the Angle it's going to go is also changing so when it's hitting the top third of the player's brick it will change its direction in an extremer angle then it would do if it hits the middle or bottom half
